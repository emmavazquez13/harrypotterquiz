 A timed quiz using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
 
 I restarted this project several times, there was alot on the CSS part that I could not figure out. I will keep working on it, and updating as much as I can. I understood the Javascript functions, and was able to see what ever function did but was not able to figure out how to style it. I used alot of resources, and tried my best. 
 
Resources I used:
